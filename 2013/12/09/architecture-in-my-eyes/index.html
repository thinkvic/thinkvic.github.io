<li>This was an old article I wrote when joining a discussion about the role of an architect. Just recollect these quick thoughts here.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>To an architect, I think learning from other disciplines is important: structural engineering, art, computer, history and philosophy, ethics…My opinion is that all these disciplines are actually just different aspects of the same thing. We look at the thing from different angles.</p>
<p>I can find many examples in the history about people who stayed in several disciplines.</p>
<p>Some figure, like da Vinci, is familiar to us all. He did well in engineering, art, sculpture, etc. There are also so many others. Just give a few examples.</p>
<p>We all know that Galileo once asked the famous questions “Will two balls of different weight fall on the ground at the same time?” He improved telescope too. Surprisingly, he also studied the failure of a cantilever beam. This was at the starting point of all the improvement in mechanics later. Without it, Mr. Wright could only have dreamed of building his Falling Water in his head. Now we can only see falling water rather than “Fallingwater.”</p>
<p>Coulomb is known in the electrical fields as his “Coulomb’s law” because he studied electric charge (named after him) and electric force. This interactions between electric charges is the basis for all the current tech we enjoyed everyday, Internet, cell phone, etc. However, in the civil engineering field, he presented the first time an adequate stress analysis of a beam. Also, he is genius in his detailed study of soil and retaining walls.</p>
<p>Thomas Young didn’t think Newton was correct about the particle theory of light. He did experiment (double-slit) to prove the wave-like property of light. However, don’t forget that he invented the property to describe the stiffness of materials, which is known to everybody in building industry.</p>
<p>Franklin got bored at staying at his room writing political documents. He flew kites to test the electricity. He also was an early supporter of the wave theory of light although it’s not popular then.</p>
<p>I believe the same for the AEC field. Learning from different disciplines can make possible finer comprehension of “the thing”. This seems to solve the dilemma above about “everyone is not making the same movie.” It also agrees with Randy’s “working in a less linear manner.”</p>
<p>For example, to me, structures and architecture are not two things (although they are always taught separately in two remotely separated departments). It’s simply one thing–STRUCTURE. If we look at it from aesthetic perspective, it becomes art. I think <a href="http://www.calatrava.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mr. Calatrava’s work</a> exemplifies this. He learns from engineering, art, descriptive geometry, etc…</p>
