Among them is one big box of books. <a id="more"></a>　Many years later, when I prepared to leave school, it’s a headache to decide what books I need to throw away. In our life, only at certain points, we would think and realize what are the most important and what not. Obviously, most of the books were destined to be in the dumpster. I kept some. One of them was the 1st real English book (published in English-speaking countries) I own. I can still remember the joy of holding something that is written completely in a new and unfamiliar language. It was mailed to me about 10 years ago from the US by my cousin and I brought it to the US when I got an opportunity to study here. So, it crossed the Pacific twice and how cruel it is to bury it in a dumpster in Mississippi. I brought it with me to Philadelphia, PA.</p>
<p>Life is really full of coincidence. The two major characters in this book studied at UPenn almost a century ago and this book was published in Pennsylvania. It’s interesting to see that this book went through a cycle of heavens and hells and it went back to its birth place.<br>The title is called “Liang and Lin”. It was beautifully written with interesting stories and poems. Liang and Lin used their Western training to initiate the study of China’s architectural evolution. Before that, almost nobody studied this subject and nothing was written on it.<br>The American art historian Wilma Fairbank painted a vivid picture of their life, their sufferings, and their achievements at schools, at work and during wartime. Personally, I found that the blend of eastern and western elements make it quite interesting.</p>
<p>Link to the book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=60XOWa68SDoC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=liang+and+lin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=obgDVInwGILNggTh8IKwDg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://books.google.com/books…</a></p>
<p>Recently, it’s a pleasant surprise to find that the house where Lin once lived in US in the 1920s is now a bookstore at 3920 Spruce Street. A city and a house are just like a central stage. The players in it change all the time. We are all temporary residents. Who knows that it will become a bookstore and who can predict that somebody will visit it 90 years later?</p>
<p>I actually missed the bookstore when passing by the first time. The sight of some boxes of books placed on the walkway for sale made me think some students living in it were selling textbooks. Unbelievably, it’s a two-storied bookstore containing a sea of books. Books of different subjects are filled everywhere in the “living room”, in the “kitchen”, in the “bedrooms”, on the stairs, on the bookshelves, leaving only narrow space for people to move around. When I heard the creaking sound when climbing upstairs, I knew I was stepping on history. And I felt that the experience of being surrounded by paper books at the information age is really unique.</p>
<p>Before leaving the bookstore, the owner told me she knew some of the stories and that Lin once stayed here. “Lin would be very happy if she knew that her room is now a sea of books.” She said it with a smile.</p>
<p>The house, the bookstore, the book, the Lin couple, the Fairbank couple, the 20th century US and China, 1920s’ Philadelphia, 21st century’s Philadelphia…… Maybe structuralism is correct: elements of human life and human culture must be understood through their interrelations and the relations to a larger overarching structure. I don’t know whether the virtual book and virtual space prevalent today are helping this understanding or not?</p>
