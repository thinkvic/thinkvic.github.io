Easy?</h1><span class="post-time">Dec 28, 2015</span><div class="post-content"><p>Anybody who works in the IT field will have the experience of fixing bugs. Sometimes, you or your boss think a bug is so easy and think it could be fixed in a second. It turns out to be a days-long job and … nightmare.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Sometimes, it is not that the problem itself is difficult. It is …</p>
<p>Fixing a flat tire could be an easy or difficult job. It’s actually not different from fixing bugs.<br>Today’s fixing a bike tire cost me 6 hours. Several years ago back at school, I could fix a flat tire in 30 min.<br>Well, the last time I did this was about 3 or 4 years ago. So, the unfamiliarity and lacking some tools is a cause. However, look at the time breakdown.</p>
<p>1. Brain storming all the tools needed and their location and searching for them. (30 min)<br>(pump, pressure gauge, wrench, levers, sand, patch, glue, a large container with water ) It’s not easy to find everything because I haven’t done it for a while as I mentioned.<br>2. Routine steps (45 min)<br>Taking the inside tube out, sanding, applying glue and patch, waiting, testing, putting it back into the tire, inflating, etc (could be faster, but got rusty in some steps.)<br>Because I don’t have rubber cement available, I wanted to use another cement instead, it turned out not working.<br>3. Disappointed! and thinking about whether to give up or find other solutions. (15 min)<br>4. Deciding to shop for rubber cement or repair kit.<br>The trip back and forth (30 min)<br>In the store, firstly a small store and then Walmart (&lt;60 min)<br>Searching in the bike section, no rubber cement or repair kit. Asked around. they don’t know either.<br>Searching all the aisles back and forth. I finally found it in the automobile section.<br>Waiting in the queue for check out.<br>5. Very happy. fixing it right away and photographing my achievement. (45 min)<br>6. Test riding happily in the local neighborhood (15 min)<br>7. Crying because it got flat again.<br>8. Examining the cause. (30 min)<br>It turns out another spot is punctured and the fixed spot is good. Ouch. I missed one important step, which is to mark and examine the tire for potential glass or nail pieces in the first place. So I searched all the way around the inside of the tire and found that piece of sharp glass. Removed it.<br>9. Repeating step 2 again and double checked it worked this time. (45 min)<br>10. Relieved and happy. Storing tools back into their place (15 min)<br>11. Thinking about what in the earth happened today and wrote this blog (&gt;30 min)</p>
<p>If you read the above carefully, sound familiar to you, too?</p>
<p>If you think carefully, you would know that the bottleneck is<br>1. Searching. It takes a long time, both at home and store. While at software level, searching now is so easy. However, in terms of real life objects, searching is still difficult. Let’s envision the future. If I say: “wrench wrench come come”, it will automatically appear in front of your eyes, faster than a google search. How much time could this save? With the IoT getting popular, this should be able to easily done, we can tag the tools and their containers and make them smart!<br>2. Forgetting a single key step in a long tedious steps. Well, if we have a digital personal assistant and when I shout to him “what’s the key steps when fixing a flat tire?”, he would reply blah blah. How nice could this be!</p>
<p>BTW, the future is promising. However, if it becomes so easy to fix a tire and bug in the future, what do we do in the free time? Sleeping?</p>
<p>Got to go to bed. haven’t prepared business causal for tomorrow yet. By the way, bug fixing is no different from fixing other things. I just feel that a professional bug fixer / professional tire fixer / professional plumber doesn’t match well with business casual. Don’t you think some pants with fresh paints are more suitable for computer bug fixers?</p>
