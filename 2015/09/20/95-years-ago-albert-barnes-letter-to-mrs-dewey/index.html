In early August, I happened to find an Albert Barnes’ letter to Mrs Dewey (John Dewey’s wife) at Barnes Foundation and was really surprised at Mr. Barnes insight into education.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Today, his ideas came to me and I felt urged to copy down the last two paragraphs to this blog. When I looked at the date of the letter, September 20th, 1920. Exactly 95 years ago! Wow.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p>I believe Democracy and Education is stuck until a practical plan is evolved to eliminate the residuum of the unconscious past, to stifle imitation, to create spontaneous interest in the <strong>worth-while things</strong> that make up progress. This inertia that comes from imitation is nicely analyzed by Santayana (Chapter 8, Reason in Art) and I believe if Mr. Dewey would begin where Santayana ends, something of real value might come of it.</p>
<p>If a successful life means an adjustment to one’s environment, I’ve been a failure. When I adjust to the people around me, I sink to lower levels of intelligence and am soon disgusted. If I go on to the higher levels, it’s a damned lonesome life. My most satisfactory adjustments are with artists and thinkers but as I don’t live with such people, the life that touches me most deeply, is the vicarious (second-hand) one with books, paintings, and music; but I am so human that the substitutes lack the satisfaction that only human beings give. I feel something like *Henry Adams did after he spent half a century in pursing education; but I disagree with him about the ability to get an intelligent education. My wail is that when you get what you are able to carry, you’re doomed to a <strong>maladjustment</strong> because when you try to pass education on to others, futility is its full name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Henry Adams (1838-1918) . His work THE EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS was finished at 1907 and won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>*”Many aspects of the contemporary world emerged during the half-century between the Civil War and World War I, a half-century coinciding with Adams’s adult life.”<br>“Adams repeatedly laments that his formal education, grounded in the classics, history, and literature, as was then the fashion, did not give him the scientific and mathematical knowledge needed to grasp the scientific breakthroughs of the 1890s and 1900s.”</p>
<p>When I found the above introduction at Wikipedia,  I was thinking: every era really has its own fashion. Now the fashion is exactly opposite. Science and tech becomes the hot topic while classics, history and literature are definitely in the cold room. I am not sure which fashion is better? Why not combine this two fashions?</p>
