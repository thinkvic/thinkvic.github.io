<p>One is about Picasso’s works around WWI time 1912-1924.<br>“Picasso: The Great War, Experimentation and Change”<br>The other is about Masterworks of French Photography 1890-1950.<br>“Live and Life Will Give You Pictures”</p>
<p>The former gave me insight into Picasso. Wow, we always associate him with cubism. However, he kept experimenting and changing immediately after he established cubism.<br>The latter let me experience first-hand the real photographs about one of my favorite historical periods. I got into such a close contact with figures like Bresson and Brassai. Their masterworks intuitively painted the social and historical contexts of that period.<br>Just like the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/arts/design/barnes-foundations-director-aims-to-unpack-the-ideas-in-the-art.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barnes’ new director said:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We like to say, ‘We’ve moved, but we didn’t unpack. We want to unpack the ideas in the works themselves. That broader social, historical, ideological context.”</p>

<p>Afghanistan through the lens of McCurry is so beautiful and mystic. I feel the photographs try to grab those deep philosophical concepts. I was fascinated by both the place and the book extracts (Caravans by James A. Michener). It gave me a strong urge to visit the place and read the book. Maybe that’s the magic of art, it inspires you beyond the works itself.</p>

<p>We are entering the era of big data, and things that we think of as qualitative can be understood quantitatively…social movements, moods, conversations, emotional interactions. We can only see the data and the computational mechanics behind it if we design a visual interface for it.</p>

<li>Design the Invisible<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, most design is not visual. Design is everywhere–and more than meets the eye. Much of it is invisible, deeply integrated into every aspect of our daily lives. In going beyond the surface, designers can reimagine and re-engineer the hidden systems behind cultural, economic, and environmental structures.</p>
